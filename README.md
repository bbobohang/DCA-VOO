# DCA-VOO
The project is to test out whether dollar cost averaging of investing is more profitable than lumpsum investing. We will be using VOO to test out for this project

The overlying concept of this project is to test the efficiency of DCA into VOO. The capital used will be 3600 USD per annum. The fees charged will be USD 8.80 for lump sum 
and USD 1 for RSP.

RSP: An buy order will be done at the open of 8th of every month. In a case that 8th is not a trading day, the capital of USD 300 will be accumulated and brought over to the next trading 8th month.
